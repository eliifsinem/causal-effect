## Detailed Results

### H1: Previous Rejections → More Reviews

**Features examined**: rejection_count, prev_rejections

**Target events**: Declaration REJECTED, Request REJECTED

**Result**: NOT SUPPORTED

**Justification**: Features related to Previous Rejections showed insufficient influence on predictions for More Reviews events, with only 0.26 importance vs. 0.05 average for other features.

**Analysis Details**:

- Hypothesis Feature Importance: 0.2565
- Other Features Average Importance: 0.0531
- Statistical Significance: p-value = 0.6626

| time_since_start | 0.0000 |
| time_since_last_event | 0.0000 |

## Implications for Process Prediction

The following hypothesized relationships were supported and provide valuable insights:

1. **Prior Approvals → Faster Confirmations**: Features related to prior approvals showed significant negative correlation with time to subsequent confirmation events, indicating that cases with prior approvals tend to receive faster final confirmations.

2. **Complex Processes → More Oversight**: Process complexity features strongly influence predictions involving supervisor actions, confirming that more complex cases consistently trigger additional management oversight.

The following hypothesized relationships were not supported and should be reconsidered:

1. **Previous Rejections → More Reviews**: Features related to Previous Rejections showed insufficient influence on predictions for More Reviews events, with only 0.26 importance vs. 0.05 average for other features.

3. **Previous Event Properties → Next Steps**: Hypothesized features not found in dataset

4. **Resource Changes → Control Shifts**: Hypothesized features not found in dataset

5. **Temporal Factors → Process Flow**: Features related to Temporal Factors showed insufficient influence on predictions for Process Flow events, with only 0.00 importance vs. 0.00 average for other features.
